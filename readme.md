## Future Plans

- Need to make the schema more robust to accomodate for different categories or packs
- Will probably need to build out authentication schemas if I end up adding authentication

## How to Start

- Run `npm i` in console to install dependencies.
- Create a .env file that will house your `MONGODB_URL`, `PORT`, and `SECRET`. The `SECRET` is optional, however.
- Run `npm run start` to spin up your backend server.
